BLOCKER REASON: LLM call failed with 403 Forbidden "Action not allowed in profile" for action "llm_generate".

Details:
- Action "llm_generate" is defined in action_matrix.py allowed_actions.
- Profile "llm_generate" is defined in gate_profiles.py.
- Payload matches allowlist: {"prompt", "model", "max_tokens"}.
- Possible causes:
  - VPS running outdated code without "llm_generate" in matrix.
  - Global matrix overridden in runtime.
  - Bug in action check logic.
- Evidence: process_llm_http.txt shows 403, not SUCCESS.

Recommendation: Update VPS code to latest, verify matrix/profile definitions, debug gate logic.
